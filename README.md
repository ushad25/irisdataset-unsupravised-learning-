# irisdataset-unsupravised-learning-
## Project Description
This project implements and compares clustering algorithms—specifically KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering—on the well-known Iris dataset. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to discover inherent groupings in data. The Iris dataset contains measurements of petal length and width for three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Goals:
Implementation: Implement KMeans and Hierarchical clustering algorithms using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn and scipy.
Visualization: Visualize the clustering results to understand how these algorithms group the iris flowers based on their petal characteristics.
Comparison: Compare the effectiveness of KMeans and Hierarchical clustering in grouping the Iris dataset.

## Outcome:
This project serves as an educational resource for learning about clustering techniques in Python, using a well-known dataset to illustrate their application. By analyzing and visualizing clustering results, users can gain insights into how these algorithms partition data and their suitability for different types of datasets.
